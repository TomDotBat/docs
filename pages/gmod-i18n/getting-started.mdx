# Getting Started
## Installation
Adding gmod-i18n to your project is easy, it can be downloaded from the GitHub releases page [here](https://github.com/TomDotBat/gmod-i18n/releases/latest).
Once downloaded, the `sh_gmod_i18n.lua` file can be copied into your project and included with the [include](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.include) method.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	It is **not** necessary to rename the `i18n` global table, however, the functionality will not be affected by doing so.
	The library is designed to automatically resolve conflicts with other versions.
