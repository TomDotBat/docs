# Configuration
The configuration file for PIXEL UI can be found at the following location:
<FileTree>
	<FileTree.Folder name="pixel-ui" defaultOpen>
		<FileTree.Folder name="lua" defaultOpen>
			<FileTree.Folder name="pixelui" defaultOpen>
				<FileTree.File name="sh_config.lua" />
			</FileTree.Folder>
		</FileTree.Folder>
	</FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Derma Menus
The default derma menus (message, query and string request popups) can be overridden by PIXEL UI with the `OverrideDermaMenus` option.
This option is disabled out of the box to avoid compatability issues, however the server owner can enable it if preferred.
There are four possible options for this setting:
1. Players are forced to use the default derma menus. *(Default)*
2. The default menus are used, however players can opt in to the PIXEL UI overrides.
3. The PIXEL UI overrides are used, however players can opt out.
4. Players are forced to use the PIXEL UI overrides.

When `OverrideDermaMenus` is set to option 2 or 3, the `pixel_ui_override_popups` convar will take effect.
This convar can be set to 0 or 1, which enables or disables the overrides respectively.

## Progress Wheel
The progress wheel which PIXEL UI presents during asset downloads can be changed to the server owner's preference with the `ProgressImageID` setting.
By default the value is set to [`635PPvg`](https://i.imgur.com/635PPvg.png), which is the image seen below:

## Color Scheme
The color scheme of PIXEL UI can be modified under the `Colors` setting. By default, the values are set to the following:

<ColorPalette colors={{
	"Background": "#161616",
	"Header": "#1C1C1C",
	"Scroller": "#3D3D3D",
}} />

<ColorPalette colors={{
	"Primary Text": "#FFFFFF",
	"Secondary Text": "#DCDCDC",
	"Disabled Text": "#282828"
}} />

<ColorPalette colors={{
	"Primary": "#2F80C8",
	"Disabled": "#B4B4B4",
	"Positive": "#428632",
	"Negative": "#A43232"
}} />

<ColorPalette colors={{
	"Gold": "#D6AE22",
	"Silver": "#C0C0C0",
	"Bronze": "#915E31"
}} />

The color scheme can be modified with no limitation.
However, some elements and third party addons may not be compatible.
Addon developers are encouraged to use the color palette when developing with PIXEL UI in order to reflect the server owner's preferences.
